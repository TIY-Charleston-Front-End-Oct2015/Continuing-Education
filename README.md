# Continuing Education
I hope you are wondering how to continue your personal growth.  How can you quench your thirst for knowledge. Unfortunately, you cannot! But, I can provide some materials that I hope will help satiate you for awhile.  
### Programming
If you don't use it, you lose it.  I'd recommend trying one or two of these every day at the minimum
* [Codewars](www.codewars.com) - Highly Recommend - Signup with your github account. Choose your language.  And begin. If you get stuck on one for 15 minutes, hit the "show me the answer" button, and it will show you how every person has ever solved the problem.  Fantastic for fine-tuning your developer skills.
* [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) - This is more math based, but it really gets your brain churning.
* [Stock Wars](http://stockwars.cidevelop.com/) - DISCLAIMER: I have not done this one.  However, I have heard good things from some friends.  For the aspiring day trader, create your portofolio and programatically change it as the stock market ebbs and flows.
* [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/) - DISCLAIMER: I have not done this one. I have read good things and at a cursory glance, it seems good.  You can skip to parts you think are more worth your time.
### Readings / Emails
It's great to stay up-to-date on the happenings in the tech world.  News letters abound- I'll list a few below and some websites I frequent to see what's going on in the tech world.  
* Websites
 - [HackerNews](news.ycombinator.com) - Similar to reddit, but tech related.
 - [Reddit](www.reddit.com/r/javascript) - This is the javascript subreddit.  But there are pletny of others, check out reactjs, angular, node, mongo, You name it. They got it.
* Weekly Emails
 - [Javascript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/)
 - [Node Weekly](http://nodeweekly.com/)
 - [HTML 5 Weekly](http://html5weekly.com/)
 - [CSS Weekly](http://css-weekly.com/)
 - [Angular Weekly](http://paper.li/RaminZamani/1366929635)
### Courses -
Some of these I have done. Many I have not.  Depending on what you are trying to sink your teeth into, there are a lot of options, and these are in no particular order.
* [Understanding Javascript - The Weird Parts](https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript/) - HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION - $15 ... and it goes on sale all the time so only buy it when it's $15.  This was a great way for me to gain a deeper understanding of how javascript is working underneath the hood. This particular lecturer has other courses, but this is his best. Highly recommended.  Plenty of other items on udemy, buy at your own risk.
* [Udacity](www.udacity.com) - Highly Recommend - Sign up, do not pay the $200, and do all the free classes you want.  They have front-end, back-end, mobile, whatever you're heart desires.  I would recommend sticking with whichever path you have already started. They have "nanodegree" programs, and these have prescribed courses you can use.  (Intro to Computer Science was the first course I took and got me interested in programming)
* [Egghead.io](www.egghead.io) - Highly Recommend - Front-End Only - DEFINITELY pay the $10 a month. These people are pros and I have learned so much from their material.
* [Coursera](www.coursera.com) - Again, don't pay the money.  The courses are free and continually rolling, and there are 1000s. Courses are hit or miss, but you can decide if it's worth your time pretty quickly.

### Open Source
Everyone loves to see you committing on github, and what better way to do this than by contributing to an open source project!? Even if it's as small as changing the Readme.md file and updating some version numbers, people love to see you helping.
* [CodeTriage](http://www.codetriage.com/) - Sign up, select your language, and then find something that sounds interesting.  There are 1000s that need your assistance.
